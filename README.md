# 📊 Simulation and Modelling Codes

Welcome to the Simulation and Modelling repository. This collection features Python-based simulations designed to analyze queuing systems, probabilistic events, and system behavior over time. These simulations demonstrate practical skills in discrete-event simulation, randomness modeling, and system optimization.

## 🚀 Projects in This Repository

### 🔁 M/M/1 Queue Simulation
- **File**: `mm1_sim.py`
- **Description**: Simulates a single-server queuing model (M/M/1). Takes mean interarrival time, mean service time, and number of customers to process as input. Outputs key performance metrics like:
  - Average delay in queue
  - Average number in queue
  - Server utilization
  - Time simulation ended

### 🎲 Roll Dice Simulation
- **File**: `roll_dice.py`
- **Description**: Simulates dice rolls to demonstrate probability distributions of outcomes. A great way to study randomness and uniform probability behavior in Python.

### 🚗 Car and Truck Traffic Simulation
- **File**: `CAR_TRUCK_SIMULATION_CAT3.py`
- **Description**: Simulates traffic flow involving both cars and trucks. Helps analyze congestion points, travel time patterns, and traffic behavior in mixed vehicle scenarios.

## 🛠️ Setup & Requirements

### ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed. Recommended editors are:

- ✅ PyCharm
- ✅ Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

### 📦 Required Python Libraries

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### 📁 Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JosephNderitu/Simulation-and-Modelling-codes.git
cd Simulation-and-Modelling-codes
```

## 🧪 Running the Simulations

### 1. M/M/1 Queue Simulation

1. Open `mm1.in` and provide three values in one line:
   ```
   [mean_interarrival_time] [mean_service_time] [number_of_customers]
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   1.0 0.5 100
   ```

2. Run the simulation:

```bash
python mm1_sim.py
```

3. Results will be saved to `mm1.out`.

---

### 2. Dice Roll Simulation

```bash
python roll_dice.py
```

---

### 3. Car and Truck Traffic Simulation

```bash
python CAR_TRUCK_SIMULATION_CAT3.py
```
